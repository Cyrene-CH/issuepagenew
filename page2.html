          Every patient has a story that goes beyond the symptoms they bring into the doctor’s office.
        </h1>
        <p>Those stories can illuminate how a person became ill, the tipping point that compelled them to seek
            help, and, perhaps most importantly, the social challenges they face in getting better. Stories can
            offer the kind of contextual richness that promotes and nourishes empathy, prompting a provider to
            switch from asking “How can I treat this disease?” to “How can I help my patient?” The difference may
            seem subtle at first, but knowing how to get patients to share their stories can be transformative in
            improving patient care, say proponents of this approach called “narrative medicine.”

          When asked about the process of writing her memoir, Dana Lorene Creighton paused in thought.

          <span class="italicText boldText " >“It’s like spilling your guts to a lined composition notebook,” she said.
         </span>

          Creighton, who has an MS in exercise physiology and has spent her career involved in clinical research and community health at both UNC-Chapel Hill and Duke, has spinocerebellar ataxia, a hereditary neurodegenerative condition characterized by a lack of muscle coordination. The illness is commonly visible through slurred speech, stumbling, falling, and incoordination due to damage to the cerebellum – the part of the brain that controls muscle coordination.
        </p>

        <p>Narrative medicine was coined as a term by Dr. Rita Charon in her book Narrative Medicine:<span class="boldText"> Honoring the Stories of Illness, to refer to “medicine practiced with the narrative skills of recognizing, absorbing, interpreting, and being moved by the stories of illness . . . .</span> Along with their scientific expertise, doctors need the expertise to listen to their patients, to understand as best they can the ordeals of illness, to honor the meanings of their patients’ narratives of illness, and to be moved by what they behold so that they can act on their patients’ behalf.”

          Dr. Mantri is familiar with the benefits of narrative medicine from a clinical perspective, holding an M.S in Narrative Medicine from Columbia University and being a leader of various narrative medicine initiatives at Duke, both with doctors and medical students.According to Dr. Mantri, elucidating these narratives is crucial to understanding that at the end of the day, doctors and patients work to navigate challenges of illnesses with different perspectives. It’s necessary to hear the story of a patient as well as understand the story of a clinician. Only then can doctors work to find moments of alignment between these two perspectives, resulting in care that is more patient-centered.
        </p>

        <p>From the patient perspective, Creighton remarks that a chapter in her book delves into narrative medicine, even though at the time she had no idea what it was. As she learned more about the field, though, it became clear just how integral narrative medicine was to her experience processing and coming to terms with her ataxia. Creighton also pointed out that as humans, “we want the same things – to feel heard and to make meaningful connections with others who can potentially help us navigate whatever condition we’re going through.”</p>
